üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started
===============

Electrum-DGB is a pure python application. If you want to use the Qt interface, install the Qt dependencies:

```sh
sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5
```

If you downloaded the official package (tar.gz), you can run Electrum-DGB from its root directory without installing it on your system; all the python dependencies are included in the 'packages' directory. To run Electrum-DGB from its root directory, just do:

```sh
./run_electrum
```

You can also install Electrum-DGB on your system, by running this command:

```sh
sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools
python3 -m pip install .[fast]
```

This will download and install the Python dependencies used by Electrum-DGB instead of using the 'packages' directory. The 'fast' extra contains some optional dependencies that we think are often useful but they are not strictly needed.
